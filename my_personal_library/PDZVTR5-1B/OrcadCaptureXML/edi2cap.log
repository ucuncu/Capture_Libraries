   ADVICE: If you DON'T LIKE the result:
    Do another orcadwrite run using one of the following sets of OrCAD writer options:
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.32000 inch(s), 'Grid'=32000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.20000 inch(s), 'Grid'=20000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.16000 inch(s), 'Grid'=16000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.10000 inch(s), 'Grid'=10000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
