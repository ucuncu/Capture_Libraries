   ADVICE: If you DON'T LIKE the result:
    Do another orcadwrite run using one of the following sets of OrCAD writer options:
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.50000 inch(s), 'Grid'=50 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.25000 inch(s), 'Grid'=25 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.20000 inch(s), 'Grid'=20 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.10000 inch(s), 'Grid'=10 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
